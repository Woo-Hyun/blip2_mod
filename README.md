# nuScenes-Text Dataset

This repository contains the nuScenes-Text dataset for autonomous driving research. This dataset is based on [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/) and includes text descriptions of objects captured by the cameras in the nuScenes dataset.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into the following structure:

```nuscenes_with_text
{ 
  "image_file_name": [                    
    {
        "attribute_tokens":        --- <str> attribute token of nuScenes
        "bbox_corners":            --- <list of float> bounding box corners of the detected object in the image
        "category_name":           --- <str> category or class of the detected object
        "filename":                --- <str> image file name
        "instance_token":          --- <str> instance token of nuScenes
        "next":                    --- <str> next token of nuScenes
        "num_lidar_pts":           --- <int> number of LiDAR points associated with the detected object
        "num_radar_pts":           --- <int> number of radar points associated with the detected object
        "prev":                    --- <str> prev token of nuScenes
        "sample_annotation_token": --- <str> sample annotation token of nuScenes
        "sample_data_token":       --- <str> sample data token of nuScenes
        "visibility_token":        --- <str> Indicates the visibility level of the object (e.g., fully visible, partially occluded)
        "caption":                 --- <str> caption generated from fine-tuned VLM
        "maneuver":                --- <str> future maneuver of the detected object
        "bev_pos":                 --- <list of float> Bird's eye view position of the object
        "chatgpt_caption":         --- <str> caption generated with "caption", "manuever", "category_name" from LLM
        "chatgpt_caption_2":       --- <str> caption generated with "caption", "manuever", "category_name" from LLM
        "chatgpt_caption_3":       --- <str> caption generated with "caption", "manuever", "category_name" from LLM
        "fake_caption":            --- <str> caption generated by rule-based script
    },
    another objects in this image ...
  ],
  "other_image_file_name": ...
}
```
